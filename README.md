# Perceptron algorithm for 2 and 3 dimension problems
 I make use of MySQL, specifally phpMyAdmin to munipulate data. So in order to run the code after download:
    
   1. - In the data folder there is a perceptron.sql file. 
   2. - From phpMyAdmin panel:
      - Create a new database and name it perceptron
      - Choose the percetron database -> push import button
      - From file to import -> choose file ( perceptron.sql ) -> import
 
 Now your database should be ready to use.
 
 In order to run the code: 
   - From the terminal cd to the project path where Perceptron2D.py and Perceptron3D.py are placed  
   Type:
   
     python perceptron_2d.py <br/>
   or <br/>
     python perceptron_3d.py
   
   Voil√†!!!  
   That's it...
